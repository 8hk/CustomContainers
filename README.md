# Custom Containers

This project is developed for SWE 510 (Data Structures and Algorithms) course @ Bogazici University. 

It has simple and not complex custom made implementations for both ArrayList and LinkedList containers.

The professor gives us following instuctions to follow for this project.


Implement the following classes:
Take-home exam:
- An abstract list class
- LinkedList and ArrayList classes
- LinkedListStack and LinkedListQueue classes
HW2:
- ArrayListStack and ArrayListQueue classes
- BinarySearchTree class

- You are free to design your classes and implement the respective methods.
- Provide capabilities of your classes and methods with appropriate
insert/delete/pop/push/queue/dequeue's and print out.
- When the instructor loads your classes and run the corresponding
"single" main method, he should observe running all the functionalities.
- include this single main method in TakeHomeHw.java
